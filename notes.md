## **The Republicans Take Power**

### An American Story

- In 1801, Washington DC was slowly rising from a swampy site on the Potomac River (puh •TOH •mihk).
- The nation’s new capital had only two prominent buildings—the president’s mansion (later called the White House) and the still-unfinished Capitol.
- Very few people liked being in Washington.

### The Election of 1800

- In 1800 Federalists supported President Adams for a second term and Charles Pinckney of South Carolina for vice president.
- Neither Adams nor Jefferson traveled around the country making speeches.
- The election campaign of 1800 differed greatly from campaigns of today.
- The letterwriting campaign, however, was not polite.
- Federalists, they claimed, only represented the interests of wealthy people with property.

### Election Deadlock 

- When members of the Electoral College voted, Jefferson and Burr each received 73 votes.
- At the time, the electors voted for each presidential and vice-presidential candidate individually rather than voting for a party’s candidates as a team.
- Because of this tie, the House of Representatives had to decide the election.
- In the House, Federalists saw a chance to prevent the election of Jefferson by supporting Burr.
- For 35 ballots, the election remained tied.
- Finally, at Alexander Hamilton’s urging, one Federalist decided not to vote for Burr.
- To prevent another tie between a presidential and a vice-presidential candidate, Congress passed the Twelfth Amendment to the Constitution in 1803.
- This amendment, ratified in 1804, requires electors to vote for the president and vice president on separate ballots.

### Jefferson’s Inauguration 

- On March 4, 1801, the day of the presidential inauguration, Jefferson dressed in everyday clothes.
- President Adams had slipped out of the presidential mansion and left the city so he would not have to watch Jefferson become president.
- He left his boardinghouse and walked to the Senate to be sworn in as president.
- In his Inaugural Address, Jefferson tried to reach out to Federalists: “We are all Republicans, we are all Federalists,” he said.
- Then he outlined some of his goals, which included maintaining  “a wise and frugal [economical] government” and “the support of state governments in all their rights.
- Jefferson believed in reducing the power and size of the federal government.
- These ideas were similar to the French philosophy of laissez-faire (LEH • ZAY FEHR), which means “let (people) do (as they choose).”
